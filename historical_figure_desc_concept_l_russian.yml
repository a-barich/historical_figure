In [Concept('historical_figure_JC58Ddo_ShinshC5AB','Jōdo Shinshū')|E], the nianfo is reinterpreted as an expression of gratitude to Amitābha. The idea behind this interpretation is that rebirth into Sukhāvatī is assured the moment one first has faith in Amitābha. This notion was propagated by the 12th century [Concept('historical_figure_Japanese_language','Japanese')|E] monk Honen, who wrote extensively about it in his extant writings, such as in the [Concept('historical_figure_One-Sheet_Document','One-Sheet Document')|E]. Honen, in turn, attributed this teaching to the 7th century Chinese monk [Concept('historical_figure_Shandao','Shandao')|E]. However, modern academic analysis and dissertation has challenged this traditional narrative. Critical reviews of Shandao’s hagiography has shown that he expounded on a variety of methods for attaining rebirth, not just exclusive practice of nianfo/nembutsu. For example, in one tract, \"The Meritorious Dharma Gate of the Samādhi Involving Contemplation of the Ocean-like Marks of the Buddha Amitābha\" Shandao prescribes a specific set of rituals and practices for helping dying Buddhist devotees avoid “evil destinies” and procure successful rebirth in the Pure Land, which contradicts the notion of faith and nianfo/nembutsu as being a guarantee of unconditional salvation. In another example, Shandao expounded on many dangers that he believed could hinder dying aspirants’ rebirths in the Pure Land in his tract, \"Correct Mindfulness for Rebirth at the Moment of Death\", and other similar records from him also reflect a concern regarding various more complicated requirements for rebirth in the Pure Land, including but not limited to recitation of Amitābha’s name on one’s deathbed specifically. These reflect a nuanced approach and goes beyond the belief in unconditional salvation as claimed by traditional narrative assumed in Pure Land sects like [Concept('historical_figure_JC58Ddo_ShinshC5AB','Jōdo Shinshū')|E] and [Concept('historical_figure_JC58Ddo-shC5AB','Jōdo-shū')|E].#!\n\n#weak Википедия#!"

 game_concept_historical_figure_Zen_desc:0 "#medium #bold Zen#! is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in [Concept('historical_figure_China','China')|E] during the [Concept('historical_figure_Tang_dynasty','Tang dynasty')|E], known as the Chan School, and later developed into various sub-schools and branches. From China, Chán spread south to Vietnam and became Vietnamese Thiền, northeast to Korea to become Seon Buddhism, and east to [Concept('historical_figure_Japan','Japan')|E], becoming Japanese Zen.\n\nThe term Zen is derived from the [Concept('historical_figure_Japanese_language','Japanese')|E] pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word 禪, an abbreviation of 禪那, which is a Chinese transliteration of the Sanskrit word dhyāna. Zen emphasizes rigorous self-restraint, meditation-practice, insight into the nature of mind and nature of things, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others. As such, it de-emphasizes knowledge alone of sutras and doctrine, and favors direct understanding through spiritual practice and interaction with an accomplished teacher or Master.#!\n\n#weak Википедия#!"
